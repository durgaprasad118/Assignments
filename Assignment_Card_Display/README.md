# Displaying Data in the form of cards
- Utilised React query for data fetching for the api endpoint (https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers)
- Fetched the data and displayed in the cards with a neat and clean UI
- Implemented Search functionality which  searches based on the names and if no data found it gives the corresponding message.
